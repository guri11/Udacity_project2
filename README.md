## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

### By Gurinder Kalsi

## Overview

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will learn about the experiment by creating a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then will go through the task ourself. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

## What will I Learn?

Project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment.
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample.
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.
